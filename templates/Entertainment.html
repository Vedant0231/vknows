          <h5 class="card-title">Adipurush get backlash</h5>
          <p class="card-text">The teaser of Prabhas' Adipurush was unveiled on October 2 amid much fanfare. It, however, failed to live up to expectations. Many felt that the visual effects were underwhelming. Some even stated that the characters did not look authentic. It was soon reported that the makers were planning to modify the film to accommodate this feedback. Director Om Raut has now reacted to these rumours. Adipurush is a mythological drama, based on The Ramayana.</p>
